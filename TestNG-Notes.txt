What Is TestNG?

- It is testing framework

- set of annotations -> 

   > help you to execute your tests ==> test methods

a selenium script/Java code enclosed inside a testNg annotation ==> Test method

- pre condition & post conditions can be given using TESTNG framework

login --> create email --> Logout

start DB connection --> execute script ---> stop the DB connection

> using TestNG xml files you can execute multiple scripts in sequence or in parallel

> TestNG also genrates a test report

> TestNG run your script with multiple set of data ==> data driven testing + apache poi

> TestNG to perform continous testing ==> along with TestNG + git+ maven+ jenkins + selenium from a remote server

Git commands for     > add a file 
                     > commit a version
                     > push a file to remote repo
                     > clone a repo


TestNg Annotations:


1. @Test  : execute your test cases

How to use this annotation

  @Test(priority='1')
  public void Testcase1() -----------> Test method
   {
     system.out.println("this is testcase1");
  }
  
 // create method dependency

 @Test(dependsOnMethods={"method1","method2"})

  public void method3()
{
}


2. @BeforeMethod : precondition ==> start chrome browser ==> this method will be executed before every test method

    @Test : execute the test cases ==> test method
    @Test  ==> test method
    @Test  ==> test method

   @Aftermethod : post condition  ==> close the browser ==> this method will be executed after every test method


  open browser ==> wikihomepage test ==> close browser

  open browser ==> loginpage ==> close browser





3. @BeforeClass ==> the method with this annotation will get executed as the first method in the class


   @Test
   @Test


  @AfterClass ==> the method with this annotation will get executed as the last method in the class


The method with annotation @BeforeClass @Before Method , @AfterClass & @AfterMethod --> condition, they are not test methods



4 @Parameters({"nameOfParameter"})
  @Test
  public void testcase( String nameOfParameter )
   {
    
    SOP (nameOfParameter);

     }


fetch the vlaue of the parameter from testng XML file

In the xml file


  <suite>
   <test>
     <parameter name=nameOfParameter value="xyz">
    <classes>
      <class>




*************************


  we have an excel sheet with data in it


Apache POI

Step 1: provide the location of excel sheet  : FileInputStream

step2 : fetch the workbook form this location : WorkBook, WorkBookFactory

step 3: fetch the sheet which data in the excel : Sheet , getSheet()

step4 : In the sheet count how many rows and how many columns have data : getLastRowNum(), getLastCellNum()

Step 5: start  for loop for the row

    Step 6:  got to each row

      Step 7: start a loop for columns

         step 8: go to each cell of every column
        

            Step 9 : fetch the contents of each cell for that row

Step 10 return the data => Object[][]
      

Step 11 : write the testNG annotation ==> @DataProvider ==> resposible to supply data to your test method

Step 12: write the test method which needs data and add parameters

Step 13: Use dataProvider option with @test annotation to pass data to your paramters
